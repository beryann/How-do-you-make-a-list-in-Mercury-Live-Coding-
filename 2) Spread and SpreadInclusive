1) spread (or spreadF for float numbers)
The first is "spread," with this example:

`list melody spread(10 0 100)`
`list length spread(7 500 20)`

which gives this:

`[0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90]`
`[500 431 362 294 225 157 88]`

Explanation for the first list:
`Melody` is a list with 5 ascending items distributed equally from 0 to 100 (except for 100!).
In the second example, we still have a distribution of data, but in a descending direction (except for the last value!).

2) spreadInclusive ( or spreadInclusiveF for float numbers) 
There is a variant of the precedent function:

"spreadInclusive"
This function allows you to include the last item in the list.

For example, in tutorial 402, you'll find these two examples:
`list melody spreadInclusive(5 0 12)`
`list length spreadInclusive(7 500 20)`
with the expected result where 12 and 20 correctly appear in the evaluation:

`[0 3 6 9 12]`
`[500 420 340 260 180 100 20]`
