How do you make a list in Mercury Live Coding? And how do you make it random?

Like any code-based language, it's possible to create lists containing values ​​that will be used later. This is the case with Mercury Live Coding, which allows you to create music and visuals using lists. These lists can be static and remain the same even if the program is re-evaluated. There are also various ways to randomize them or make them evolve over time using specific functions that we will explore here.
