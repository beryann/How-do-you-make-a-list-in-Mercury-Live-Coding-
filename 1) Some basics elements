How do you make a list in Mercury Live Coding? And how do you make it random?

Mercury has a very simple tool in terms of language and syntax: you write the word list followed by a name you choose—preferably related to what the list will be used for—followed by [ x y z etc], knowing that x, y, or z can be a number or the name of a sample.

For example:

list numb [ 1 2.3 4 10 23 etc]

or

list smp [ sample 1 sample 2 sample 3 etc]

Example from tutorial 106:

list hatBeat [1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1]
new sample hat_808 time(1/16) play(hatBeat)

or from tutorial 108:

list drumSounds [kick_909 hat_909 snare_909 hat_909]
new sample drumSounds time(1/8) 

It's the basic principle that is used everywhere and a lot in Mercury ! 

What should I do now if I want to randomize a list to vary the order in which the sounds appear? 
You will find various simple tutorials on this topic.

Let's examine them one by one...

Starting with tutorial 401, you will find (and also in the official documentation) the functions that allow you to vary these lists in different ways.
